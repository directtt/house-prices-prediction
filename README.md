# ml-house-prices
Python Machine Learning Regression Project that predicts house prices based on Kaggle Dataset. <br>
Data was prepared in Pandas, the whole EDA was made in Seaborn and prediction was made by algorithms from Scikit-Learn & XGBoost packages. <br>
The final model led me to the top 5% of the competition leaderboard. <br> (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
